# Dreka ground control software

Dreka GCS designed as modern, lightweight and cross-platform app for UAS mission control and planning. Functionality can be extended with modules and 3rdparty service integrations. By default Dreka GCS can be used for planning and control of the MAVLink-capable drones, ADS-B and aeronavigation data visualizing from [OpenSky-Network](https://opensky-network.org/). It uses [Cesium](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium) library for  3D globe and able to work offline with Cesium Ion service. This is reboot of [JAGCS](https://github.com/MishkaRogachev/JAGCS) project.
